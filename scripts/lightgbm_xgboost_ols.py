# version 42
#    Going to try putting subsequent version comments at the bottom,
#      hoping that will might solve the problem with LightGBM results
#        changing when comments are the only difference

# version 41
#    Revert to single XGB model, as in version 37

# version 40
#    Try a different average (rounds=240 and 250) -> LB .0644095

# version 38
#    Try two XGB fits averaged (rounds=250 and 260) -> LB .0644081

# version 37
#    Shot in the dark: num_boost_rounds=250 for XGB -> LB .0644074

# version 36
#    Back to 0.6300, and set num_boost_rounds per CV -> LB .0644207

# version 34
#    Try XGB_WEIGHT = 0.6315 -> .0644087

# versomp 33
#    Tru XGB_WEIGHT = 0.6334, to do new quadratic approximation
#    LB .0644087

# version 32
#    Try XGB_WEIGHT = 0.63, LB = .0644086

# version 31
#    Change threshold to 0.419, per huiqin, LB = .0644096

# version 30
#    OK, never mind...

# version 28
#    Get rid of lot size, per Jayaraman

# version 27
#    Roll back to version 24/21

# version 26
#    Last one was wrong. I meant to bring back fireplacecnt.
#    LB 0.0644248, even worse than the mistake

# version 25
#    Bring back fireplaceflag, LB 0.0644245, never mind

# version 24
#    Revert to old BASELINE_WEIGHT and some cleanup

# version 21
#    Try BASELINE_WEIGHT = 0.0050, LB .0644125

# version 12
#    Try XGB_WEIGHT .6266, to do quadratic approximation, LB .0644123, already near-optimal

# version 11
#    Try XGB_WEIGHT .620 -> .6166, closer to old proportion, LB .0644133

# version 10
#    OLS_WEIGHT=.055, LB .0644127

# version 9
#    OLS_WEIGHT=.05, LB .0644129

# version 8

# version 7
#    First attempt:  
#    OLS_WEIGHT=.06, LB .0644129
#    (XGB_WEIGHT=.62 to keep proportion with LGB roughly same as in old script)




# THE FOLLOWING SERIES OF COMMENTS REFERS TO VERSIONS OF
#    https://www.kaggle.com/aharless/xgb-w-o-outliers-lgb-with-outliers-combined
#    from which this script was forked

# version 61
#   Drop fireplacecnt and fireplaceflag, following Jayaraman:
#     https://www.kaggle.com/valadi/xgb-w-o-outliers-lgb-with-outliers-combo-tune5

# version 60
#   Try BASELINE_PRED=0.0115, since that's the actual baseline from
#     https://www.kaggle.com/aharless/oleg-s-original-better-baseline

# version 59
#   Looks like 0.0056 is the optimum BASELINE_WEIGHT

# versions 57, 58
#   Playing with BASELINE_WEIGHT parameter:
#     3 values will determine quadratic approximation of optimum

# version 55
#   OK, it doesn't get the same result, but I also get a different result
#     if I fork the earlier version and run it again.
#   So something weird is going on (maybe software upgrade??)
#   I'm just going to submit this version and make it my new benchmark.

# version 53
#   Re-parameterize ensemble (should get same result).

# version 51
#   Quadratic approximation based on last 3 submissions gives 0.3533
#     as optimal lgb_weight.  To be slightly conservative,
#     I'm rounding down to 0.35

# version 50
#   Quadratic approximation based on last 3 submissions gives 0.3073 
#     as optimal lgb_weight

# version 49
#   My latest quadratic approximation is concave, so I'm just taking
#     a shot in the dark with lgb_weight=.3

# version 45
#   Increase lgb_weight to 0.25 based on new quadratic approximation.
#   Based on scores for versions 41, 43, and 44, the optimum is 0.261
#     if I've done the calculations right.
#   I'm being conservative and only going 2/3 of the way there.
#   (FWIW my best guess is that even this will get a worse score,
#    but you gotta pay some attention to the math.)

# version 44
#   Increase lgb_weight to 0.23, per Nikunj's suggestion, even though
#     my quadratic approximation said I was already at the optimum

# verison 43
#   Higher lgb_weight, so I can do a quadratic approximation of the optimum

# version 42
#   The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything
#     comes down to a slightly higher lgb_weight

# version 41
#   Trying Nikunj's suggestion of imputing missing values.

# version 39
#   Trying higher lgb_weight again but with old learning rate.
#   The new one did better with LGB only but makes the combination worse.

# version 38
#   OK back to baseline 0.2 weight

# version 37
#   Looks like increasing lgb_weight was better

# version 34
#   OK, try reducing lgb_weight instead

# version 32
#   Increase lgb_weight because LGB performance has imporved more than XGB
#   Increase learning rate for LGB: 0029 is compromise;  CV prefers 0033
#     (and reallly would prefer more boosting rounds with old value instead
#      but constaints on running time are getting hard)

# Version 27:
#   Control LightGBM's loquacity

# Version 26:
# Getting rid of the LightGBM validation, since this script doesn't use the result.
# Now use all training data to fit model.
# I have a separate script for validation:
#    https://www.kaggle.com/aharless/lightgbm-outliers-remaining-cv
